# Lab Setup
The goal of this lab is to successfully prepare your environment for the remainder of the labs. We will be using a variety of technologies including 

### Requirements
- VirtualBox
- Santoku Linux Virtual Machine
- Xcode installed on your local machine

### Task 1: Clone This Repository
On your local machine in an easy-to-find location (such as the Desktop) run the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/ManicodeSecurity/iOS-Attack-Defense
```

### Task 2: Download and Install DVIA 
[Damn Vulnerable iOS Application](http://damnvulnerableiosapp.com/) is an intentionally insecure iOS application built to help students and researchers learn about iOS security in a legal environment. It was built by [@prateekg147](http://twitter.com/prateekg147) as free and open source software. We will use DVIA extensively throughout the course. 

Everything needed to install DVIA is located in the `DVIA-v2` directory of this lab. 

We will be compliing the DVIA source code using Xcode. In the `DVIA-v2` directory you will see a file called `DVIA-v2.xcworkspace`. Open this file in Xcode to start exploring the application and run the emulator.

### Task 3: Compile the Application


### Task 4: Santoku Linux Setup
[Santoku Linux](https://santoku-linux.com/) is an open-source virtual machine that comes pre-installed with a number of useful tools needed for mobile security testing, malware analysis, and mobile forensics. 

If you have not already downloaded the .ISO file, please do so now. 

Please follow the directions outlined in the official [Santoku Linux Documentation](https://santoku-linux.com/howto/installing-santoku/installing-santoku-in-a-virtual-machine/) to complete the setup in VirtualBox.

*! Important !* Please ensure VirtualBox Guest additions is installed per the instructions.
