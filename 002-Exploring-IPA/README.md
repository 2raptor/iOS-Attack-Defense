# Exploring an iOS Application
The goal of this lab is to unzip a few .ipa files and inspect their contents. The .ipa file is readily available to attackers and is the first stop for the curious to understand what is going on in your application.

### Task 1: Unzip the Application

You can find a copy of the DVIA .ipa file in the `apps` directory. We will use this to start learning how iOS applications are investigated by attackers.

```
# in the apps directory
unzip DVIA-v2-swift.ipa
```

Take a look around the DVIA and get a feel for the structure. 

In the `apps/other_apps` directory you will find a few .ipa files that are made for Jailbroken devices. Pick an app and unzip it and begin exploring. Note: These IPAs were picked at random and may or many not not have security vulnerabilities.
